# ITARLE_QUANTS
Itarle Quantitative Analyst Interview Task

## Description
This project presents a comprehensive analytical study of statistical metrics derived from a dataset containing 4 daysâ€™ worth of tick data for 100 Scandinavian blue-chip stocks. The dataset, accessed via AWS and organised into a substantial CSV file, was provided as part of a key recruitment task for Quantitative Analysts at Itarle. This task is designed to simulate the daily responsibilities of the Quantitative Strategies and Development Team.

The preprocessing and extraction of metrics from this dataset were executed using C++. The study focuses on several critical metrics: the time between trades, tick changes, bid-ask spreads, and the round number effect.

By examining these parameters, the study aims to uncover patterns and inefficiencies within the market, thereby contributing valuable insights to both theoretical research and practical applications in algorithmic trading. This task not only provides a clearer understanding of the role but also reflects real-world analytical challenges encountered in the position.
